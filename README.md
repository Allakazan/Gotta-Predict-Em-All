# Gotta-Predict-Em-All
A Neural Network made with Python and Tensorflow (Keras) to classify all the first 151 Pokem√≥ns, have fun :heart:

# Dataset
Original 151 Pokemon Image Search Results dataset on Kaggle  
I won't put the dataset on this repo by file size reasons (almost 9GB), but you can find here:

https://www.kaggle.com/brkurzawa/original-150-pokemon-image-search-results

The file structure in your project needs to be: **[PROJECT_ROOT]/pokemon**, basically in the same level at this README file.
